Proc:  
------- 
r: How many processes are waiting for CPU time. 
b: Wait Queue - Process which are waiting for I/O (disk, network, user  
    input,etc..)  


Memory:  
----------- 
swpd: shows how many blocks are swapped out to disk (paged). Total Virtual   
memory usage. 

Note: you can see the swap area configured in server using  "cat  proc/swaps" 


free: Idle Memory  
buff: Memory used as buffers, like before/after I/O operations 
cache: Memory used as cache by the Operating System 


Swap:  
--------- 
si: How many blocks per second the operating system is swapping in. i.e  
    Memory swapped in from the disk (Read from swap area to Memory) 
so: How many blocks per second the operating system is swaped Out. i.e  
     Memory swapped to the disk  (Written to swap area and cleared from  
     Memory) 


In Ideal condition, We like to see si and so at 0 most of the time, and we definitely donâ€™t like to see more than 10 blocks per second. 


IO: 
------ 
bi: Blocks received from block device - Read (like a hard disk)  
bo: Blocks sent to a block device - Write 


System:  
------------- 
in: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock.  
cs: The number of context switches per second.  


CPU: 
-------- 
us: percentage of cpu used for running non-kernel code. (user time, including  
     nice time)  
sy: percentage of cpu used for running kernel code. (system time - network, IO  
     interrupts, etc)  
id: cpu idle time in percentage. 
wa: percentage of time spent by cpu for waiting to IO. 




If you used to monitor this data, you can understand how is your server doing during peak usage times.  


Note: the memory, swap, and I/O statistics are in blocks, not in bytes. In Linux, blocks are usually 1,024 bytes (1 KB).
